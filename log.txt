"notes": "The provided angle has little effect. Angles from 14 to 90 are shown with a slant of 14 degrees, like `font-style: oblique` without a provided angle. Angles from -90 to 13 are generally shown without slant, like `font-style: normal`. In some situations, like with a vertical `writing-mode` being used, a negative angle does produce a slant."
