Is it really a partial implementation even? Seems to me they check the angle and make it either `font-style: normal` or `font-style: italic` based on the provided degree. It seems to me Chrome simply doesn't 


Sure, it works as in that it doesn't break, but that's nowhere near the intended behaviour. I haven't gotten my Chrome to do anything with any value of `font-synthesis-style`

I did find some additional resources:

An issue created based on CSS Working Group's decision to disallow fallback from oblique to italic and to synthesize oblique when requested: https://issues.chromium.org/issues/393389580

Issue about slanting glyphs to the left not working: https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40065409

w3 tests page, where Gecko passes two of the three tests, while Blink and Webkit fail: http://w3.org/International/i18n-tests/results/int-letterforms.html

Also a bug report Chrome behaves even more weirdly: https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40788851

On the test page provided in that issue: https://output.jsbin.com/juyawoh if I tweak the degrees of the property relevant to the `font-style: oblique -15deg` box followingly:
 - the default value of -15 that's set on the page slants all characters to the left, as well as does any negative value from -90 to -1
 - value of 0 produces normal text - none of the latin characters, arabic numerals and logograms are slanted in any way
 - values from 1 to 13 only slant the latin characters and arabic numerals
 - values of exactly 14 slants all of the characters
 - values from 15 to 90 slant none of the characters

The angle of the slant doesn't vary, it's just left, right or none. In Firefox the logograms are slanted to the degree, while latin characters and arabic numerals seem to become italics.
